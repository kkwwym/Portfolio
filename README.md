The purpose of a dashboard is to view the most important results at a glance. Dashboards are an interactive way to see how the project perform. I can use PowerBI and Tableau. Here is an example I use Power BI to build a data professional dashboard.

## Projects

Going to build a recommendation engine to recommend movies based on a movie that we have watched. This project is an interactive movie recommendation system that allows you to type in a movie name and immediately get ten recommendations for other movies you might want to watch.

As players progress through the game they will encounter gates that force them to wait some time before they can progress or make an in-app purchase. This sort of "time gate" is usually seen in free-to-play models, and normally contains ads that can be skipped using credits. In this project, I am going to analyze the result of an A/B test where the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to 40.
