# Portfolio
### Description
This portfolio is compiled by Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for previous reasearch, self-learning, virtual internship and issue of interest. 
To demonstrate practical ability, most of projects use real world data. 

Each of the following projects will contain a **README.md** file to summarize the content of the project. The process of the entire project will be displayed in a **project.jpynb** file.
Other information such as code details, dataset or sources will also be included.

Continually updated for learning and implementing on machine leanrning or other related field...
